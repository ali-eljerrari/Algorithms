Greedy algorithms are algorithms that make locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum. Here's an overview:

1. **Greedy Choice Property**: A problem exhibits the greedy choice property if making a locally optimal choice at each step leads to a globally optimal solution.

2. **Optimal Substructure**: Greedy algorithms typically solve problems by recursively making a series of choices that lead to an optimal solution.

3. **No Backtracking**: Unlike dynamic programming, greedy algorithms make decisions based solely on the information available at the current step without considering future consequences or backtracking.

4. **Examples**:
   - **Coin Change**: Given a set of coin denominations and a target amount, find the minimum number of coins needed to make the target amount. The greedy approach would involve selecting the largest denomination coins first until the target amount is reached.
   - **Fractional Knapsack**: Given items with certain weights and values, and a knapsack of limited capacity, find the maximum value that can be obtained by selecting fractional amounts of the items. The greedy approach involves selecting items with the highest value-to-weight ratio first.
   - **Prim's Algorithm**: Find a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph by repeatedly adding the smallest edge that connects a vertex in the tree to a vertex outside the tree.

5. **Correctness**: Greedy algorithms do not always produce optimal solutions, and it is crucial to prove their correctness by demonstrating the greedy choice property and optimal substructure.

6. **Performance**: Greedy algorithms are often simple to implement and efficient in terms of time complexity. However, they may not always guarantee the best possible solution, especially for problems with complex or non-greedy optimal solutions.

Overall, greedy algorithms are useful for solving optimization problems where making locally optimal choices leads to an acceptable global solution. However, they require careful analysis to ensure correctness and may not always be applicable to all problem domains.

Let's consider the example of the "Coin Change" problem:

**Problem**: Given a set of coin denominations (e.g., `[1, 5, 10, 25]`) and a target amount (e.g., 30 cents), find the minimum number of coins needed to make the target amount.

**Greedy Approach**:
1. Start with an empty solution (i.e., no coins selected).
2. At each step, select the largest denomination coin that is less than or equal to the remaining amount.
3. Repeat step 2 until the remaining amount becomes 0.

**Example**:
Let's solve the "Coin Change" problem for the target amount of 30 cents using coin denominations `[1, 5, 10, 25]`:

1. Start with an empty solution: `amount = 30, coins = []`.
2. Select the largest denomination coin less than or equal to 30: 25. Update the solution: `amount = 5, coins = [25]`.
3. Select the largest denomination coin less than or equal to 5: 5. Update the solution: `amount = 0, coins = [25, 5]`.

The solution is `[25, 5]`, which uses two coins (25 cents and 5 cents) to make 30 cents.

While the greedy approach works for the standard coin denominations (e.g., quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies), it may not always produce the optimal solution for arbitrary sets of coin denominations. However, in this case, the greedy approach does provide the optimal solution.

Divide and conquer is a problem-solving technique that involves breaking down a problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems, solving each subproblem independently, and then combining their solutions to form the overall solution. Here's an overview:

1. **Divide**: Break the problem into smaller subproblems that are similar to the original problem but smaller in size. This step often involves dividing the input data into two or more parts.

2. **Conquer**: Solve the subproblems recursively. If the subproblems are small enough, solve them directly using a base case.

3. **Combine**: Combine the solutions of the subproblems to form the solution to the original problem. This step often involves merging or aggregating the solutions of the subproblems.

4. **Recursion**: Divide and conquer algorithms typically use recursion to solve the subproblems. Each recursive call works on a smaller portion of the problem until a base case is reached.

5. **Examples**:
   - **Merge Sort**: Sorts an array by dividing it into two halves, sorting each half recursively, and then merging the sorted halves.
   - **Binary Search**: Searches for a target value in a sorted array by dividing the array in half at each step and recursively searching the appropriate half.
   - **Quick Sort**: Sorts an array by partitioning it into two subarrays, sorting each subarray recursively, and then combining the sorted subarrays.

6. **Performance**: Divide and conquer algorithms can be highly efficient when the problem can be divided into smaller subproblems that can be solved independently. However, they may require additional memory due to recursion and may not be suitable for problems with overlapping subproblems or where the overhead of recursion is high.

7. **Optimization**: Some divide and conquer algorithms can be optimized using techniques such as memoization (storing intermediate results to avoid redundant computation) or tail recursion optimization (reducing stack space usage).

Overall, divide and conquer is a powerful problem-solving technique used in a wide range of algorithms and applications, including sorting, searching, and optimization problems.

Let's consider the example of the Merge Sort algorithm:

**Problem**: Given an unsorted array, sort it in non-decreasing order.

**Divide and Conquer Approach**:
1. **Divide**: Divide the array into two halves.
2. **Conquer**: Recursively sort the two halves.
3. **Combine**: Merge the sorted halves to produce the final sorted array.

Here's how the Merge Sort algorithm works:

```js
MergeSort(arr[], l, r)
1. If l < r
   a. Find the middle point to divide the array into two halves:
      middle = (l+r)/2
   b. Call MergeSort for the first half:
      MergeSort(arr, l, middle)
   c. Call MergeSort for the second half:
      MergeSort(arr, middle+1, r)
   d. Merge the two halves sorted in step 2b and 2c:
      Merge(arr, l, middle, r)

Merge(arr[], l, middle, r)
1. Create temporary arrays L[] and R[] to hold the left and right halves.
2. Copy data to temporary arrays L[] and R[].
3. Merge the two temporary arrays back into arr[l..r]:
      a. Initialize indices i, j, and k to 0 for arrays L[], R[], and arr[] respectively.
      b. While i < n1 and j < n2:
           If L[i] <= R[j], assign L[i] to arr[k] and increment i and k.
           Otherwise, assign R[j] to arr[k] and increment j and k.
      c. Copy any remaining elements of L[] and R[] to arr[].
```

**Example**:
Let's sort the array `[38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]` using Merge Sort:

1. Divide the array into two halves: `[38, 27, 43, 3]` and `[9, 82, 10]`.
2. Recursively sort each half:
   - `[38, 27, 43, 3]` becomes `[3, 27, 38, 43]`.
   - `[9, 82, 10]` becomes `[9, 10, 82]`.
3. Merge the sorted halves: `[3, 9, 10, 27, 38, 43, 82]`.

The sorted array is `[3, 9, 10, 27, 38, 43, 82]`.
